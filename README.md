# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis

## Overview

This analysis was made in order to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This is done in order to help with the upcoming wave of retirements. 

## Results
Here are the highlights of the results from the analysis: 

* Most of the upcoming retirements are from the senior engineer and senior staff positions, with respectively 29414 and 28254 retiring employees expected to retire
* Only two managers are expected to retire
* There are over 90000 employees expected to retire
* There are over 1500 current employees that are eligible for the mentorship program

## Summary

As mentionned in the results, there are 90398 employees across 7 different positions that are expected to retire with the "silver tsunami". All these roles must therefore be filled. However because there are only 1549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program, there will be enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

There are some additional queries that may provide more insight on the upcoming retirement wave such as:
* Querying the total salaries of retirement-ready employees per department, so that the departments can prepare the budgets accordingly
* Querying the number of retirement-ready employees by department and by title, so that management can plan any new hires necessary accordingly
